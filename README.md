Here I created my first class in java, a basic Factorial class.
All that this does is find the factorial of the numbers that you put into it, including negatives though I'm not sure 
whether one can actually have a negative factorial. Besides that, it runs headlessly until one closes it and asks for
input from the user. It also checks to see if the user really meant to put in a negative value before finding the factorial
of that number. If the person chooses no or "n" in this case, the console asks for another input.

In order to allow for larger numbers to be used and calculated, the "long" value was used. This should allow a wider
range of values to be inputted and calculated. 

Note: The main method takes no arguments and is just used to gain input for the factorial methods.

Possible problems: The main method runs on a "while" loop and so could cause a hassle by staying open after you are done 
using the methods. This was done in order to allow the methods to be used more than once without having to reopen the
class again. Be careful to completely close it after you're done so that you don't use your computer to heat the room
that you're in.

Any suggestions are welcome! I hope to be making more basic things and critique will greatly help me.
